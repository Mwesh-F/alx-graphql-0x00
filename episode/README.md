# Episode Query by ID

This task demonstrates how to retrieve a specific episode's details using the `episode(id: ID!)` field from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API.

Each `.graphql` file contains a query to get an episode by its ID, and the corresponding `.json` file stores the actual response.

Queried fields:
- id
- name
- air_date
- episode
